# Missing Features & Edge Cases

## SFTP Features

### Remote to Remote Transfer
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Description:** Currently only supports local↔remote transfers. Need server-to-server direct transfers.  
**Implementation needed:**
- UI: Add "Remote Source" panel alongside existing local/remote panels
- Backend: Create dual SFTP client handler that streams between two SSH sessions
- Transfer: Direct pipe from source SFTP to destination SFTP without local storage
- Progress: Track bytes transferred between remote endpoints
- Use case: Copy files between staging/production servers, sync between remote locations
