## First Connection

### Creating a Connection

1. **Launch FreeSH** - Open the application
2. **Click "New Connection"** - Located in the top-right corner of the home screen
3. **Fill in connection details:**
   - **Name**: A friendly name for this connection (e.g., "Production Server")
   - **Host**: The server address (e.g., `example.com` or `192.168.1.100`)
   - **Port**: SSH port (default is `22`)
   - **Username**: Your SSH username

### Authentication Methods

FreeSH supports two authentication methods:

#### Password Authentication
1. Select **"Password"** as the authentication method
2. Enter your password
3. Optionally check **"Save to Keychain"** to securely store your password

#### SSH Key Authentication
1. Select **"SSH Key"** as the authentication method
2. Click **"Browse"** to select your private key file
   - Common locations:
     - macOS/Linux: `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
     - Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\.ssh\id_rsa`
3. If your key has a passphrase, enter it
4. Optionally check **"Save to Keychain"** to store the passphrase

### Connecting

1. Click **"Save"** to save the connection
2. Click **"Connect"** to establish the SSH connection
3. On first connection, you'll be asked to verify the host key
4. Click **"Accept"** to add the host to your known hosts

### Host Key Verification

When connecting to a server for the first time, FreeSH will show you the server's host key fingerprint. This is a security measure to ensure you're connecting to the correct server.

**What to do:**
- If you recognize the server and trust it, click **"Accept"**
- If you're unsure, verify the fingerprint with your server administrator
- The host key will be saved to your known hosts file

## Quick Tour

### Home Screen
The home screen shows all your saved connections. You can:
- **Search** for connections using the search bar
- **Organize** connections into groups/folders
- **Quick connect** by clicking any connection

### Terminal Tab
Once connected, you'll see:
- **Terminal window** - Your SSH session
- **Tab bar** - Switch between multiple sessions
- **Menu bar** - Access features like SFTP, port forwarding, and settings

### Opening SFTP
Click the **"SFTP"** button in the tab bar to open the file browser for the current connection.

### Local Terminal
Click **"Local Terminal"** in the home screen to open a terminal on your local machine.

## Next Steps

Now that you're connected, explore these features:

- [**Connection Management**](/connections/overview) - Organize and manage your connections
- [**Terminal Features**](/terminal/overview) - Learn about terminal capabilities
- [**SFTP File Transfers**](/sftp/overview) - Transfer files between servers
- [**Port Forwarding**](/port-forwarding) - Set up SSH tunnels

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed
- Verify the host address and port are correct
- Check that SSH is enabled on the remote server
- Ensure your firewall allows outbound SSH connections
- Verify your username and authentication credentials

### Permission Denied
- Double-check your username
- Verify your password or SSH key is correct
- Ensure your SSH key has the correct permissions (`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`)
- Check that your user account has SSH access on the server

### Host Key Changed Warning
If you see a warning that the host key has changed:
- This could indicate a security issue (man-in-the-middle attack)
- Or the server was reinstalled/reconfigured
- Only accept if you know the server was legitimately changed
- You can remove the old key from Settings → Known Hosts
